### Part 1: A Form to Know

<Accordion>

Create a webpage containing a form that displays an input text box, radio buttons, checkboxes, and select items; along with a script that executes form validation.

Your script should validate whether the user has entered data in the input text box, has checked a radio button, has checked at least one checkbox, and has selected an option from the list of options in the select element.

Use a submit button to invoke the validation script, so that the form is processed only when the form fields are valid. If a field is invalid then display a message to the user.

In your form statement, use method="post" and an action that can be a mailto or a webpage(displaying that the form has been processed), but be sure to use input type="submit" for your submit button. Alternatively you can leave out the form's action and method, but then you should use an input type="button", along with displaying any appropriate messages.

Make sure that if you display an error message because of a single field, you do not clear out the whole entire form unless all the fields would have error messages associated to them! It's horrible to have the user fill out all the form again when there was only one field with error, right? Remember about this type of detail that is related to user experience!

Perhaps you have something...

<div class="row">

<form name="myform" action="mailto:wpuckett@mail.ccsf.edu" method="post" enctype="text/plain" on:submit={validate}>

<div class="one-half column">
  <textarea class="u-full-width" name="textBox" bind:value={textBox} placeholder="Something you've been wanting to say?" required></textarea>
  <input type="radio" id="case1" name="meaning" value="this" bind:group={meaning} required> <label for="case1">Perhaps this...</label>
  <input type="radio" id="case2" name="meaning" value="orthis" bind:group={meaning} required> <label for="case2">Or this?</label> 
  <input type="radio" id="case3" name="meaning" value="these" bind:group={meaning} required> <label for="case3">Or even these?</label><br>
