### Part 1: Dealer's Choice

<Accordion>

Create a webpage in which users are allowed to select a page layout and formatting through the use of the className property. Choose at least three form elements such as: radio buttons, select items, checkboxes, and buttons to allow the user to change some CSS property of the page such as: background color, font size, font family, font style, and font weight. You may use JavaScript or jQuery for this.

You should not ignore any of the choices made by the user which means that once a choice is made, it should remain active on the page or the area selected to apply the changes. The choice should be applied when the choice is made! For example, if you give radio buttons for the background color, such as: cyan, light green, or orange and the user chooses orange, the orange background should be applied immediately! Then, after that choice, in another option you give checkboxes for the user to choose font bold, and/or font italic and the user selects both checkboxes, then the page should maintain the background color chosen from the radio button and apply the new styles (**bold font** and *italicized font*) as well. 

In case of checkboxes, if the user uncheck the mark of a checkbox, the style that was unchecked should be removed from the page or area selected!
