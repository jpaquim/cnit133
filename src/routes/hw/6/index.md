##### _Please note:_

I have been working on improving the _PageRank_ score of this site over the past few weeks, and have implemented webpack for content bundling and minification.

If you'd like to see the code as I wrote it, feel free to check out the repository on github using the ðŸ”§ icon in the footer.
