### AJAX Applications

<p class="accordian">Click to show/hide assignment.</p>
<div class="panel">


Recreate the 'gethint' Ajax example fromÂ [W3Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_ajax_php.asp). Use the php file containing the hints and expand them to include several more names as hints (at least 10 more names).

Do some research and include in that page a paragraph presenting a REST API that you could use in an application and the URL to the documentation of that API - it cannot be any Github API, neither BART as both of those two have been mentioned in the lecture! You can start your research [here](https://apilist.fun/) - your paragraph or table should contain at least the following information: What type of response file you get (JSON, XML, etc.)? Do you need any type of key to access and use the API? You need also to provide a link to any type of documentation that would help the developer use the API.  
  
Note: It is recommended to upload your php script (file) to the web hosting server, into the same directory where your HTML file resides. Be sure to give your php directory read and execute permissions (chmod 700 or 755 php). Remember that you can use the setup script, after login in Hills (using Terminal in Mac or using PuTTY in Windows), and the script will set up automatically the right permissions to any files and folders from the public\_html down in case you get the FORBIDDEN message to the .php program you will upload.

ATTENTION!!!

- You will need to use a web server that supports PHP - the Github as a web server WILL NOT WORK!!!
- Remember that you will need to upload the php file to the Hills server (or the web server you are using that needs to support PHP)!

#### Get a Clue!

When you start typing a name below, we'll try and help you find a match!

<form action="">
  <label for="fname">First name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" onkeyup="showHint(this.value)">
</form>

Suggestions: <span id="txtHint"></span>

#### An API Exploration: SWAPI

The API I selected is [The Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev). You can get the response in JSON by appending "?format=json," or use the web interface. It's probably curl-able as well, but who uses curl anymore? My favorite way to access it is with [httpie](https://httpie.io/cli). They have a gui as well. 

SWAPI doesn't require a key, so it's great for testing and exploring by anybody. It's also accessible via [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/swapi-graphql/). The documentation for the API is available [here](https://swapi.dev/documentation).
