# CNIT 133 Class Homework

A little project to assemble my CNIT 133 homework site.

Live site can be viewed at <https://mootrpootr.com>.

Styled with [ðŸ’€ Skeleton:](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton) A Dead Simple, Responsive Boilerplate for Mobile-Friendly Development. 

Webpack pushed the lighthouse score up quite a bit on mobile.
