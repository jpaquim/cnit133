# EXTRA CREDIT

The exchange rates for 1 U.S. dollar in July 2019 were:

Euro	0.89
Canadian Dollar	1.31
Hong Kong Dollar	7.80
Japanese Yen	108.38
Mexican Peso	19.11
Create a web page containing a script that the user will input an amount in U.S. dollars and display in a table its equivalent in each of the above foreign currencies, rounded to 2 decimal places. The amounts should be shown aligned to the right (right justified).

For example: an input of 10 U.S. dollars yields:


Euro	8.90
Canadian Dollar	13.10
Hong Kong Dollar	78.00
Japanese Yen	1083.80
Mexican Peso	191.10
 

Use jQuery to display 'Click to Show/Hide Instructions' above the table and upon clicking this then display 'The foreign exchange rates in July 2019' and 'Enter a dollar amount in the table below to see the corresponding foreign exchange values'. See this jQuery example: Show/Hide Panel example (Links to an external site.).

I suggest using the following display:


Click to Show/Hide Instructions

Monetary Exchange Rates
Currency	Rate	Value
British Pound		
Canadian Dollar		
Euro		
Japanese Yen		
Mexican Peso		
Enter Amount of U.S. Dollars	
Use jQuery to color the input text box to the right of 'Enter Amount of U.S. Dollars' when the user clicks in that box. For an example, see source code in: https://hills.ccsf.edu/~cdasilva/cnit133/jquery8.html (Links to an external site.) 

Note: that the above values for rates can be displayed as faded text within a grey box, by using the attribute of disabled in the form input statements. An alternative is to use the attribute of readonly, which will display the rates as normal text within a grey box.
