<div id="panel">
A large company pays its salespeople on a commission basis. The salespeople receive $200 per week, plus 9% of their gross sales for that week. For example, a salesperson who sells $5000 worth of merchandise in a week receives $200 plus 9% of $5000, or a total of $650. You have been supplied with a list of the items sold by each salesperson. The value of these items are as follows:

|Item|Value|
|-|-|
|1|239.99|
|2|129.75|
|3|99.95|
|4|350.89|

Create a web page that contains a script that includes at the top of your formÂ  a text box for the salesperson's name for the user to enter. When the user's mouse hovers over this name field, use the jQuery UI tooltip coding to display the message "Please make sure that the salesperson's name is spelled correctly".

See this site for more about the [jQuery UI tooltip](http://jqueryui.com/tooltip/).  

Next input that salesperson's items sold. Then calculates how much the salesperson sold and how much they earned, and then output the results. Be sure to round the outputted results to 2 decimal places. Use input boxes to input the number sold for each of the items 1-4. You should also check for valid numeric input (make sure the number of items sold is never negative, < 0, as nobody sells negative number of items, right?) and right-justify all amounts. Here is an [image](https://ccsf.instructure.com/courses/45830/files/5904950/preview) showing a possible display that is using tables, and form elements (labels, input boxes, buttons, etc.)
