### Extra Credit: Generating ASCII Art

<div id="panel">

Create a webpage that contains a script that reads in the size of the side of a square and displays a hollow square of that size constructed of asterisks. Your script should work for squares only for side sizes between 2 and 10 inclusive. Display an error message if the user enters any number that is not between 2 and 10 and, of course, **DO NOT PRESENT THE SQUARE**. Be sure that the output looks like a square. A common error is having the top and bottom row of asterisks appear to be smaller than the sides. [Hint: use nested while or for statements and use a monospaced CSS style for the output.]
